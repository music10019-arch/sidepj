# US Election Data Visualization 🗺️

https://music10019-arch.github.io/sideProjectFront/

An interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring US House of Representatives election results (2020-2024) through an interactive state map and detailed district-level analysis.

## Features

- **Interactive US Map**: Click on any state to view detailed election results
- **Year Selection**: Filter results by election year (2020-2024)
- **District-Level Data**: View comprehensive voting data broken down by congressional district
- **Party Color Coding**: Visual distinction between Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and other party candidates
- **Dynamic Tooltips**: Hover over states to see state names with smooth visual feedback ִֶָ𓂃 ࣪˖ ִֶָ🐇་༘࿐
- **Responsive Data Display**: Results update dynamically based on user selections

## Technical Stack

<!-- ### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with political party color schemes
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core application logic and data processing -->

### Libraries!!!
- **D3.js (v7.8.5)**: Data visualization and SVG manipulation
- **TopoJSON**: Efficient geographic data handling and rendering

### Data
- CSV format: `House_2020_24.csv` containing election results
- TopoJSON format: `states10m.json` for US state boundaries
- U.S. House 1976–2024 from: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2

``` -->

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Data Loading**: CSV election data is loaded asynchronously on page load
2. **Year Population**: Available election years are extracted and populated in the dropdown
3. **State Selection**: Users click on a state in the interactive map
4. **Year Selection**: Users choose an election year from the dropdown
5. **Results Display**: District-level results are filtered, grouped, and rendered in tables

### Key Components

#### Election Data Module (`election-data.js`)
- Loads and parses CSV election data
- Manages state and year selection
- Filters and groups data by congressional district
- Renders election results in tabular format with party color coding

#### Map Module (`map.js`)
- Converts TopoJSON to GeoJSON format for rendering
- Uses Albers USA projection for accurate geographic representation
- Implements interactive hover effects and tooltips
- Handles state selection click events

<!-- ## Usage

1. **Open the Application**: Load `index.html` in a web browser
2. **Select a State**: Click on any state in the map (highlighted in gold when selected)
3. **Choose a Year**: Select an election year from the dropdown menu
4. **View Results**: Explore district-by-district election results with candidate names, parties, vote counts, and percentages -->

<!-- ## Data Structure

The application expects CSV data with the following columns:
- `state`: Two-letter state abbreviation
- `year`: Election year
- `district`: Congressional district number (0 for at-large)
- `candidate`: Candidate name
- `party`: Political party affiliation
- `candidatevotes`: Number of votes received
- `vote_percentage`: Percentage of votes -->

This repository contains practice exercises focusing on core functionality only. Version control, code review, and full implementation are not yet complete. Please expect temporary code, incomplete features, and possible inconsistencies.

<!-- ## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Best viewed on desktop/laptop screens (1200px+ width recommended) -->

## Future Enhancements

- Statistics summary panel
- Additional election years
- Mobile-responsive design
- Data export functionality
